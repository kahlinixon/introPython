# 1. What is the difference between 
# a parameter and an argument in a python function\
"The diffrence is that one is a variable and ythe other one isnt as where it is a value."
# 2. In your own words, describe what 
# a conditional statement (if/else) is 
"a conditionl statement is fundamental coding construnctions for functions."
# 3. write a simple conditional state using a comparision operator(greater than, less than, etc. )
"it_is_cold=true"
"if it is summer=false"
print("do not wear shorts")
"else:"
print("wear a jacket")
# 4. Write a conditional statement for food in the refridgerator.
# your conditional statement should be wrapped in a function that takes one (1)
# parameter. The data type for this parameter should be true or false. 
# your function should have a line of code that asks the user if there is food in the refridgerator.
# If there is food in the refridgerator, print time to cook. If there is 
# NOT food in the fridge, print time to shop. 
# When you call your function there should be an argument that accepts 
# a boolean. 
"food in refridgerator=false"
"if no food in refridgerator=true"
"else"
print("do not order takeout")
print("order takeout")
# 5. Create a function that checks the inventory of cereal for a store. 
# your function should have a parameter that accepts an integer. In your function
# use a conditional statement to determine if you need to order more cereal.
# If there is more than 10 boxes, print "inventory full", else if there are less than 
# 10 boxes print "we need to order more cereal".
"def" "number or cereal () :"
"number of boxes=10"
print=("invetory full")
