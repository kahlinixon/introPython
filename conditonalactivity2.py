# 1. Write a function that uses a conditional statement. 
# Your function should return a message that will determine if
# class is over or not depending on the argument passed into your function.
# IF the time of class is greater than 11.30 (for AP section) or
# 1.00(for intro), your funcion should return a message saying 
# "class is over. Time to go". 
# ELSE if it is not, then your function should return a message saying
# "class is still in session."
# your function should also alow the user to put in the time. The time should be 
# formatted as a float. 
def  classTime():

else:
    print('class is not over')

    # 11:30=intro Over

    #print("")

# 2. Write a function that uses a conditional statement. 
# your function should determine what type a pet a user has depeding on the data provided by the user
# passed into the functions argument. 
# IF the user types in "woof", the function should return a message saying that it is a dog.
# IF the user types in "meow", the function should return a message saying that it is a cat.
# ELSE, if it is none of the animal sounds the function should return a message saying it doesn't 
# know what the animal is.

if:
    userType=woof="{?-}"
    print('pet type is dog')
else
     print('pet type is cat')
# 3. Write a function that will take in a user name and height as parameters. 
# Your function should evaluate and determine if the user is tall in enough to get on a roller coster.
# IF the user is over 5.5, the function should return a custom message saying the user's name
# and a message "welcome please buckle up".
